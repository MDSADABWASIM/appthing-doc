# Push notifications

Push notifications are a way for your app to send messages to your users, even when your app is not open.

## How to implement push notifications?

- Go to your firebase project folder.
- Make sure you have push notifications enabled.
- Now you can use your firebase console to send push notifications to your users.
- We even support showing notification when the app is in foreground, using local notification service.
