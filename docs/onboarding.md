# Onboarding

Onboarding is the initial guide that users see when they first open your app. It's a great way to help users get started with your app and make them feel welcome.

## How to implement onboarding?

- It's already implemented in the project.
- You just need to update the **onboarding** view with your image and text.


## Next step

Go to **[Auth setup](auth.md)** section.
